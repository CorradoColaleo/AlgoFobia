Welcome to my algorithm playground! ğŸ§ ğŸ’¡ Here you'll find a collection of solved exercises covering fundamental algorithmic techniques, including:

âœ‚ Divide and Conquer â€“ Split, conquer, and merge like a pro!
ğŸ“œ Dynamic Programming â€“ Memoization and tabulation to save the day!
ğŸ”„ Backtracking â€“ Exploring all possibilities (and backtracking when needed ğŸ˜…).
ğŸ”¢ Sorting Algorithms â€“ Because order matters!
ğŸŒ³ Trees â€“ Branching out into structured data!
This repo is my personal journey through problem-solving, and I hope it helps others navigate the wild world of algorithms. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute! ğŸ¤“âœ¨

Happy coding! ğŸš€ğŸ”¥
